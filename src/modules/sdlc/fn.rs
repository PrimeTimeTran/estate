      You are executing BUILD STEP {step}/{total}.

      YOUR CURRENT TASK:
      {instruction}

      ---

      IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
      {plan}

      ---

      CURRENT AGENT CONTEXT:
      {workspace}

      ---

      EXECUTION RULES:

      1. Start by reasoning from the task, implementation plan, and agent context
         already provided above. Do not retrieve information that is already
         available to you.

      2. Use the `context` action when you need to inspect the actual contents
         of a file or artifact provided through agent context, or when you need
         additional curated context that was not included in the prompt.

      3. Use `run_command` when you need to inspect or modify the actual
         filesystem, repository, source code, build system, tests, or other
         external state.

      4. Do not use filesystem commands merely to locate or read a file that is
         already available through agent context. Use `context` for that.

      5. Before modifying existing source files, inspect the relevant files from
         the actual repository using `run_command` as necessary.

      6. Perform the work directly in the workspace.

      7. Do not merely describe what should be done. Take the concrete action.

      8. Complete only the current build step.

      9. Preserve existing project conventions and correct work from previous
         build steps.

      10. When this step is complete, stop and report the result.

      ---

      DECISION ORDER:

      Information already provided
          ↓
      context (only if additional curated file contents are needed)
          ↓
      run_command (when actual repository/filesystem interaction is needed)
          ↓
      make the required changes
          ↓
      verify the result
          ↓
      finish
