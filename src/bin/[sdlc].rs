/// ## AI-Native SDLC playbook
///
/// A reimagined software development process that combines the control objectives
/// of the traditional SDLC with automated enforcement and continuous feedback.
///
/// Instead of treating development as a linear sequence of handoffs, the
/// AI-native SDLC treats it as a controlled loop. AI participates throughout
/// the lifecycle, producing artifacts, executing work, evaluating evidence,
/// and triggering the next stage when its exit criteria are satisfied.
///
/// The fundamental principle is:
///
/// ```text
/// Human intent
///      ↓
///   intent.md     WHY
///      ↓
///    spec.md      WHAT
///      ↓
///    plan.md      HOW
///      ↓
/// Implementation
///      ↓
/// Tests / Evals / Checks
///      ↓
/// Verification
///      │
///      ├── fail ──→ Build → Verify
///      │
///      └── pass
///           ↓
///         Deploy
///           ↓
///        Maintain
///           │
///           └──── new problem / opportunity ────→ intent.md
/// ```
///
/// The process therefore becomes a feedback system rather than a collection
/// of disconnected development phases.
///
/// ### Artifacts
///
/// Each session produces a durable chain of artifacts connecting intent to
/// implementation and evidence:
///
/// - `intent.md` — **why**
///   - Human-defined goal, motivation, scope, constraints, and unknowns.
/// - `spec.md` — **what**
///   - Concrete requirements and behavioral/design specification derived from
///     the intent.
/// - `plan.md` — **how**
///   - Ordered implementation strategy, affected files, dependencies, risks,
///     alternatives, and verification strategy.
/// - `code` — **implementation**
///   - The source changes required to satisfy the specification.
/// - `tests/evals` — **evidence**
///   - Deterministic tests, builds, type checks, linting, browser checks,
///     semantic evaluations, and other verification signals.
/// - `progress.md` — **execution state**
///   - What actually happened during the session, including deviations,
///     failures, retries, discoveries, and verification results.
///
/// The artifacts form a chain of accountability:
///
/// ```text
/// intent.md
///    │
///    ▼
/// spec.md
///    │
///    ▼
/// plan.md
///    │
///    ▼
/// code
///    │
///    ▼
/// evidence
///    │
///    ▼
/// deployment
/// ```
///
/// `progress.md` records the execution of that chain rather than replacing
/// any of the artifacts above.
///
/// ### Session
///
/// A session is one complete attempt to move a unit of work from intent
/// through deployment.
///
/// A session is stored under:
///
/// ```text
/// ./log/sessions/26-09-21.intent-title/
///     intent.md
///     spec.md
///     plan.md
///     progress.md
/// ```
///
/// The directory is the authoritative record of the session.
///
/// `./log/sessions.json` is an index of sessions and their outcomes. It should
/// contain enough metadata to discover and summarize sessions without having
/// to read every artifact.
///
/// A session must:
///
/// - Create a uniquely named directory using the format
///   `YY-MM-DD.intent-title`.
/// - Materialize the session templates from `./ai/template/`.
/// - Adapt those templates to the specific session.
/// - Maintain `progress.md` throughout execution.
/// - Record the final outcome in `./log/sessions.json`.
///
/// The session index is an index, not the source of truth. The session
/// directory contains the authoritative artifacts.
///
/// ### 1. Plan
///
/// Traditional development begins with requirements gathered by committees,
/// workshops, and sign-offs and eventually written into a document.
///
/// The AI-native process begins with an explicit human intent that can be
/// consumed by both humans and agents.
///
/// #### Outcome
///
/// `intent.md` aligns humans and AI on:
///
/// - Goal
/// - Motivation
/// - Scope
/// - Out of scope
/// - Constraints
/// - Success criteria
/// - Known unknowns
///
/// The stage must:
///
/// - Create a new directory in `./log/sessions/` using the session naming
///   convention.
/// - Create `intent.md` from `./ai/template/intent.md`.
/// - Populate it with the intent specific to the session.
/// - Establish the human-approved starting point for the session.
///
/// The agent may clarify or structure the intent, but the human remains the
/// authority on what the system is intended to accomplish.
///
/// ### 2. Design
///
/// The accepted intent is transformed into an explicit specification.
///
/// #### Outcome
///
/// `spec.md` defines what must be true when the work is complete.
///
/// It should describe:
///
/// - Functional requirements
/// - Behavioral requirements
/// - Interfaces and constraints
/// - Relevant architecture
/// - Non-goals
/// - Acceptance criteria
///
/// The stage must:
///
/// - Create `spec.md` from `./ai/template/spec.md`.
/// - Derive the specification from `intent.md`.
/// - Identify ambiguities before implementation begins.
/// - Establish requirements that can later be verified.
///
/// The specification is the contract against which implementation is
/// evaluated.
///
/// ### 3. Build
///
/// The accepted specification is converted into an implementation plan.
///
/// The agent then implements the plan while continuously validating local
/// assumptions.
///
/// #### Outcome
///
/// - `plan.md` describing the implementation strategy.
/// - Source changes implementing the plan.
/// - Tests/evals covering the requirements.
/// - Documentation updated where required.
/// - `progress.md` recording actual execution.
///
/// `plan.md` should describe:
///
/// - Files and components expected to change.
/// - Order of implementation.
/// - Dependencies.
/// - Testing strategy.
/// - Risks.
/// - Alternatives considered.
/// - Expected verification signals.
///
/// Build is not complete merely because code exists. It is complete when
/// there is a candidate implementation that can be submitted to verification.
///
/// The agent may discover information during implementation that invalidates
/// the original plan. Such discoveries should be recorded in `progress.md`
/// and may require the plan or specification to be revised before continuing.
///
/// ### 4. Verify
///
/// Verification is the control system of the SDLC.
///
/// The agent does not get to declare the session complete. The verification
/// system determines whether the implementation satisfies the specification.
///
/// ```text
///                 Build
///                   │
///                   ▼
///             deterministic
///                checks
///                   │
///                   ▼
///             semantic evals
///                   │
///                   ▼
///               evaluate
///              ↙         ↘
///           failure       pass
///             │             │
///             ▼             ▼
///         return to       Deploy
///           Build
/// ```
///
/// Verification should combine multiple kinds of evidence.
///
/// #### Deterministic evidence
///
/// Evidence whose result can be established directly by software:
///
/// - Unit tests
/// - Integration tests
/// - Type checking
/// - Linting
/// - Formatting
/// - Build success
/// - Schema validation
/// - Browser/E2E checks
/// - Security checks
/// - Artifact validation
///
/// These checks should remain deterministic wherever possible.
///
/// #### Semantic evidence
///
/// Some requirements cannot be reduced to simple assertions.
///
/// Examples include:
///
/// - Does the implementation actually satisfy the stated intent?
/// - Does the behavior match the specification?
/// - Is the resulting documentation understandable?
/// - Does the implementation introduce an obvious requirement mismatch?
///
/// These can be evaluated using structured AI evaluation.
///
/// JEV-style evaluations belong here.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```text
/// intent.md
///     │
/// spec.md
///     │
/// implementation / diff
///     │
/// verification evidence
///     │
///     ▼
///   JEV evaluation
///     │
///     ├── requirements satisfied?
///     ├── intent aligned?
///     ├── blocking issue?
///     └── remaining risk?
/// ```
///
/// JEV provides semantic evidence; it does not replace deterministic tests
/// or human accountability.
///
/// #### Verification loop
///
/// When verification fails:
///
/// ```text
/// Verify
///   │
///   ├── deterministic failure ──→ Build
///   │
///   ├── semantic failure ───────→ Build
///   │
///   └── human-required decision ─→ Human
///                                  │
///                                  ▼
///                                Build
/// ```
///
/// The loop continues until the required verification gates pass or a human
/// explicitly intervenes.
///
/// #### Outcome
///
/// A successful verification produces an evidence record containing the
/// results of the checks and evaluations.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```text
/// tests:             passed
/// build:             passed
/// typecheck:         passed
/// lint:              passed
/// intent_alignment:  evaluated
/// requirements:      evaluated
/// blocking_issue:    evaluated
/// risk:              evaluated
/// ```
///
/// Verification therefore answers:
///
/// > "What evidence do we have that the implementation satisfies the
/// > specification?"
///
/// rather than:
///
/// > "Does the agent say that it is finished?"
///
/// ### 5. Deploy
///
/// Deployment moves a verified change from the development state into its
/// intended environment.
///
/// Human review and governance remain explicit control points where required.
/// The purpose of the automated lifecycle is not to remove human judgment,
/// but to ensure that humans are reviewing a well-defined artifact with
/// reproducible evidence.
///
/// #### Outcome
///
/// - Verified implementation is deployed.
/// - Deployment metadata is recorded.
/// - `./log/sessions.json` is updated with the session outcome.
/// - A `./doc/.changeset` entry is created when the project requires one.
/// - The deployed commit/version/artifact is associated with the session.
///
/// Administrative bookkeeping should be generated from the session rather
/// than reconstructed manually after deployment.
///
/// ### 6. Maintain
///
/// Maintenance closes the lifecycle loop.
///
/// Production is observed for:
///
/// - Bugs
/// - Regressions
/// - Operational failures
/// - Security issues
/// - New requirements
/// - User feedback
/// - Opportunities for improvement
///
/// A production signal does not merely create a bug ticket. It can become
/// the input to a new SDLC session.
///
/// ```text
///              Deploy
///                 │
///                 ▼
///              Maintain
///                 │
///        ┌────────┴────────┐
///        │                 │
///     healthy          new signal
///        │                 │
///        │                 ▼
///        │             new intent
///        │                 │
///        └─────────────────┘
///                  │
///                  ▼
///               Plan
/// ```
///
/// #### Outcome
///
/// - Production state is observed.
/// - Issues and opportunities are captured.
/// - Significant new work produces a new `intent.md`.
/// - The new intent begins another session.
///
/// Git commits are part of preserving and identifying the resulting state,
/// but committing code is not the purpose of Maintain. Maintain exists to
/// close the feedback loop between the deployed system and future intent.
///
/// ## Control model
///
/// The AI-native SDLC separates three different forms of authority:
///
/// ```text
/// Human judgment
///      │
///      │ defines intent / approves decisions
///      ▼
/// Agent execution
///      │
///      │ implements and iterates
///      ▼
/// Verification system
///      │
///      │ produces evidence
///      ▼
/// Deployment gate
/// ```
///
/// These should not be conflated.
///
/// - **Human** decides what should be built and where judgment is required.
/// - **Agent** performs the implementation work.
/// - **Deterministic tooling** establishes facts about the implementation.
/// - **AI evaluation** provides structured semantic evidence where deterministic
///   checks are insufficient.
/// - **Verification** determines whether the required evidence has been
///   satisfied.
/// - **Deployment** occurs only after the required gates pass.
///
/// The central design principle is therefore:
///
/// > AI performs the work, artifacts preserve the reasoning, verification
/// > establishes evidence, and humans retain authority over intent and
/// > consequential decisions.
